# Specialties

Specialties are the first way you have to improve your statistics in growth or combat scenarios.

## Tree Split

There is a clear split in the specialties tree beween combat (left 2 columns) and growth (right 2 columns)

Before you engage in combat you should **ALWAYS** switch your specialties over to the *combat* tree as not doing so drasticly decreases your chances of being victorious.

## COMBAT

When looking at which specialties to choose for *combat*, the following are recommended:

- CREW ATK I
- CREW HP I
- CREW ATK II
- CREW HP II

Which specialties should be chosen to improve specific crews depends on which crew types you have chosen to have the most of.

Avoid CREW DEF, unless you're going for specific scenarios.

## GROWTH

Probably the game scenario you will spend the most time in, as growing your turf is a lengthy process.

The following specialties are recommended:

- CONSTRUCTION SPEED I (as long as you have buildings to upgrade): *decreases the time to upgrade buildings*
- INVESTMENT SPEED I: *decreases the time to research investments*
- CREW LOAD CAPACITY I: *increases the amount of resources your crew can carry, so decreasing the amount of troops tied up in resource gathering. Also impacts the amount of resources you can steal from other players :)*
- ROBBERY SPEED I: *Decreases the time required to collect resources*
- CONSTRUCTION SPEED II
- INVESTMENT SPEED II
- ROBBERY SPEED II
- CREW LOAD CAPACITY II
- TRAINING SPEED I: Decreases the time it takes to train crew.
- TRAINING SPEED II

When you are starting out the resource (cash, cargo, arms, metal, diamond) production increases can be beneficial, but as you progress through the game most (if not all) of your resources will come from robberies or taking them from other players.
